# Structural explanations for protein thermal stability using temperature sensitive mutants

Final Year Project for Biocheminstry degree at Imperial College London looking into which kinds of structural features account for protein stability.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Programs used

* [Missense3D](http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~missense3d/) - A binary classifier of disease causing mutants and structural changes
* [FoldX](http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/) - Predictor of changes in folding dG upon a point mutantion

### Prerequisites used

Python packages used for this project

```
matplotlib
pandas
numpy
